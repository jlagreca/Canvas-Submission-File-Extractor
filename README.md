# Canvas-Submission-File-Extractor

This simple Ruby script will extract the submission files for each assignment in each of the courses listed in the courses.csv. In this version you must use the Canvas_course_id. The files are put into named folders /Course_SIS_ID/Assignment_ID/User_ID. If there are multiple submissions by a student, all of the files will be copied across.
